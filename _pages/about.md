I am an Assistant Professor and the Director of the [HCI Lab](https://hcilab.github.io). My research in Human-Computer Interaction broadley focuses on improving how people communicate, share information and work together through ubiquitous, always available technology. I am particularly interested in cooperative work, collaborative play, and technology that promotes health and supports therapy. This work has often leveraged mixed reality, mobile, game and web technologies to explore and study new design.
