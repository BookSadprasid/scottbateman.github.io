I am an Associate Professor and the Director of the [HCI Lab](https://hcilab.github.io). My research in Human-Computer Interaction focusses on cooperative work, collaborative play, and technology that promotes health and supports therapy. This work has often leveraged mixed reality, mobile, game and web technologies to explore and study new designs.
